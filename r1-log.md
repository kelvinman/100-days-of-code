The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [February 25, Sunday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on getting quotes from Quotes on Design API and showing on quote-new-tab-page. Been getting error when trying to get new quotes with JSON. Did some research and found out it was due to cross domain request and fixed it with JSONP https://github.com/kelvinman/quote-new-tab-page/

### R1D2
Fixed new quote appending under current quote and added some styles with CSS. Quote has to be targeted and removed in the right order to avoid errors https://github.com/kelvinman/quote-new-tab-page/

### R1D3
Add ability to tweet current quote and more style tweak with CSS. Getting the tweet button to work was easier than I thought. Also learned how to create nice looking button in CSS without framework https://github.com/kelvinman/quote-new-tab-page/

### R1D4
Quote New Tab Page is now responsive. Learned that vertical padding is relative to elementâ€™s width not height and knowing that helped me understand how to create responsive elements with CSS https://github.com/kelvinman/quote-new-tab-page/

### R1D5
A responsive web based payment application. Getting a lot more comfortable using CSS to create responsive design but also CSS in general. Next step is to work on Javascript https://kelvinman.github.io/payment-app/

### R1D6
Set up JSON server on Heroku and connect it to Front-end interface of the Adigami platform. Deployed my first Node.js Apps on Heroku. The workflow is actually very similar to git but it's a little more complicated. Defintely very useful to know and can't wait to deploy more apps on Heroku https://kelvinman.github.io/Materialize/

Metric boxes are now update on change. Getting more comfortable parsing JSON data and showing the useful data. Also learned about PageSpeed and rules that help websites load fast on all devices https://kelvinman.github.io/Materialize/

### R1D10
Added a function to round float to 2 significant digits using .toPrecision() function in Javascript. Still need more work to keep data display at all time https://kelvinman.github.io/Materialize/
