# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting quotes from Quotes on Design API and showing on quote-new-tab-page.

**Thoughts** Been getting error when trying to get new quotes with JSON. Did some research and found out it was due to cross domain request and fixed it with JSONP.

**Link(s) to work**: [Quote New Tab Page](https://github.com/kelvinman/quote-new-tab-page)
