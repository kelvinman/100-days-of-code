# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting quotes from Quotes on Design API and showing on quote-new-tab-page.

**Thoughts** Been getting error when trying to get new quotes with JSON. Did some research and found out it was due to cross domain request and fixed it with JSONP.

### Day 2: February 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed new quote appending under current quote and added some styles with CSS.

**Thoughts** Quote has to be targeted and removed in the right order to avoid errors.

### Day 3: February 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Add ability to tweet current quote and more style tweak with CSS.

**Thoughts** Getting the tweet button to work was easier than I thought. Also learned how to create nice looking button in CSS without framework.

### Day 4: February 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Quote New Tab Page is now responsive.

**Thoughts** Learned that vertical padding is relative to elementâ€™s width not height and knowing that helped me understand how to create responsive elements with CSS.

### Day 5: March 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: A responsive web based payment application.

**Thoughts** Getting a lot more comfortable using CSS to create responsive design but also CSS in general. Next step is to work on Javascript.

### Day 6: March 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Set up JSON server on Heroku and connect it to Front-end interface of the Adigami platform.

**Thoughts** Deployed my first Node.js Apps on Heroku. The workflow is actually very similar to git but it's a little more complicated. Defintely very useful to know and can't wait to deploy more apps on Heroku.
